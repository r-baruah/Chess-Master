- **Problem**: Critical state stored in memory (lost on restart)
- **Impact**: Data loss, scaling limitations, memory leaks
- **Solution**: Implement Redis-based state management
- **Priority**: Critical for reliability (this week)

### 3. **Error Handling Inconsistencies** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
- **Problem**: Inconsistent error patterns, difficult debugging
- **Impact**: Unpredictable behavior, maintenance challenges
- **Solution**: Standardized error handling framework
- **Priority**: High (next 2 weeks)

### 4. **Message Link Processing Vulnerabilities** ðŸŸ¡ HIGH
- **Problem**: Limited validation of Telegram message links
- **Impact**: Security risks, potential crashes, data corruption
- **Solution**: Comprehensive link validation system
- **Priority**: Security risk (next 2 weeks)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Enhancement Opportunities
