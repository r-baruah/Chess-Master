**Epic**: ChessMaster Community Platform Enhancement  
**Story ID**: CM-001  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 2 weeks  

## User Story

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Details
```sql
-- Users table with anonymous identity
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    anonymous_id VARCHAR(64) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    telegram_id BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'contributor',
    permissions JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Courses table with anonymous attribution  
CREATE TABLE courses (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    banner_link TEXT,
    contributor_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending_review',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Anonymous ID Generation
```python
import hashlib
import secrets
from datetime import datetime

def generate_anonymous_id(telegram_id: int, salt: str = None) -> str:
    """Generate cryptographic anonymous ID with no reverse lookup"""
    if not salt:
        salt = secrets.token_hex(32)
    
    # Combine telegram_id + timestamp + salt for uniqueness
    data = f"{telegram_id}:{datetime.utcnow().timestamp()}:{salt}"
    return hashlib.sha256(data.encode()).hexdigest()
```

### Redis Configuration
```python
# Redis connection setup for state management
REDIS_CONFIG = {
    'host': os.getenv('REDIS_HOST', 'localhost'),
    'port': int(os.getenv('REDIS_PORT', 6379)),
    'db': int(os.getenv('REDIS_DB', 0)),
    'decode_responses': True,
    'socket_connect_timeout': 5,
    'socket_timeout': 5,
    'retry_on_timeout': True,
    'health_check_interval': 30
}
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed and tested
- [ ] Integration verification tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated for new database schema
- [ ] Migration procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met and documented
- [ ] Security review completed for anonymous ID system
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented

## Dependencies
- Supabase project setup and credentials
