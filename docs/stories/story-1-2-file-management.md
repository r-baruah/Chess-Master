# Story 1.2: Enhanced Multi-Channel File Management

**Epic**: ChessMaster Community Platform Enhancement  
**Story ID**: CM-002  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1.5 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (Core Infrastructure Foundation)

## User Story
As a **contributor**,  
I want **reliable file storage across multiple backup channels with anonymous forwarding**,  
so that **my courses remain accessible even if primary channels fail while protecting my identity**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Multi-Channel Storage Architecture
- [x] Channel configuration system supporting primary and multiple backup channels
- [x] Automatic channel registration and permission verification
- [x] Channel type classification (primary, backup, archive) with metadata
- [x] Dynamic channel addition/removal through admin interface
- [x] Channel capacity monitoring and management

### AC2: Automatic File Duplication System
- [x] Real-time file duplication across all configured backup channels
- [x] File integrity verification after duplication (checksum validation)
- [x] Duplication status tracking and error handling
- [x] Bandwidth optimization for large file operations
- [x] Duplicate detection to prevent redundant storage

### AC3: Health Monitoring and Failover
- [x] Channel availability monitoring with regular health checks
- [x] Automatic failover logic when primary channels become unavailable
- [x] Channel performance metrics (response time, success rate)
- [x] Alert system for channel failures and degraded performance
- [x] Load balancing across healthy channels

### AC4: Message Link Management
- [x] Secure message link extraction and storage in Supabase
- [x] Message link validation and format verification
- [x] Link expiration monitoring and refresh mechanisms
- [x] Backup link management with priority ordering
- [x] Link access permission verification

### AC5: Anonymous File Forwarding System
- [x] Anonymous file retrieval without revealing source channels
- [x] File forwarding that preserves contributor anonymity
- [x] User request handling with permission verification
- [x] File delivery tracking without identity correlation
- [x] Bandwidth management and rate limiting per user

## Integration Verification

### IV1: Channel Failover Testing
**Test**: Files remain accessible through backup channels when primary fails
- [x] Primary channel deletion/restriction doesn't break file access
- [x] Automatic failover to backup channels within 30 seconds
- [x] File delivery success rate >99.9% during channel failures
- [x] No user-facing errors during channel transitions
- [x] File access logs show successful failover operations

### IV2: User Experience Continuity
**Test**: Current file sharing workflows continue unchanged
- [x] Existing file download commands work without modification
- [x] File delivery speed maintained (within 10% of current performance)
- [x] User interface remains identical for file requests
- [x] No additional user actions required for file access
- [x] Inline search continues to return accurate file results

### IV3: Anonymous Privacy Protection
**Test**: Anonymous forwarding preserves complete contributor privacy
- [x] No traceability from delivered file to original contributor
- [x] Source channel information not exposed to recipients
- [x] File metadata stripped of identifying information
- [x] Anonymous forwarding logs contain no identity correlation
- [x] Third-party analysis cannot determine file origins

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Channel Configuration Schema
```sql
-- Enhanced channels table
CREATE TABLE channels (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    channel_id BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    channel_username VARCHAR(100),
    channel_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, -- 'primary', 'backup', 'archive'
    status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active', -- 'active', 'degraded', 'failed'
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 100, -- Lower number = higher priority
    capacity_limit BIGINT DEFAULT NULL, -- Max files (if applicable)
    current_files INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    last_health_check TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    health_score INTEGER DEFAULT 100, -- 0-100 health rating
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- File storage tracking
CREATE TABLE file_storage (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    course_file_id UUID REFERENCES course_files(id),
    channel_id UUID REFERENCES channels(id),
    message_id BIGINT NOT NULL,

### Multi-Channel Storage Implementation
```python
class MultiChannelManager:
    def __init__(self, supabase_client, bot_client):
        self.supabase = supabase_client
        self.bot = bot_client
        
    async def store_file_multi_channel(self, file_data, course_id):
        """Store file across multiple channels with redundancy"""
        channels = await self.get_healthy_channels()
        storage_results = []
        
        for channel in channels:
            try:
                # Forward file to channel
                message = await self.bot.send_document(
                    chat_id=channel['channel_id'],
                    document=file_data['file_path'],
                    caption=f"Course: {course_id}"
                )
                
                # Store message link
                storage_result = await self.store_message_link(
                    course_id, channel['id'], message.id, message.link
                )
                storage_results.append(storage_result)
                
            except Exception as e:
                await self.handle_storage_error(channel, e)
                
        return storage_results
```

### Health Monitoring System
```python
class ChannelHealthMonitor:
    def __init__(self, supabase_client, bot_client):
        self.supabase = supabase_client
        self.bot = bot_client
        
    async def check_channel_health(self, channel_id):
        """Perform health check on channel"""
        try:
            # Test channel access
            chat = await self.bot.get_chat(channel_id)
            
            # Test message sending (if permitted)
            test_msg = await self.bot.send_message(
                channel_id, "Health check", disable_notification=True
            )
            await self.bot.delete_messages(channel_id, test_msg.id)
            
            # Update health score
            await self.update_health_score(channel_id, 100)
            return True
            
        except Exception as e:
            await self.update_health_score(channel_id, 0)
            await self.alert_channel_failure(channel_id, str(e))
            return False
```

### Anonymous File Forwarding
```python
class AnonymousFileForwarder:
    def __init__(self, supabase_client, bot_client):
        self.supabase = supabase_client
        self.bot = bot_client
        
    async def forward_file_anonymously(self, user_id, file_id):
        """Forward file to user while preserving anonymity"""
        # Get file from best available channel
        file_info = await self.get_file_from_best_channel(file_id)
        
        if not file_info:
            raise FileNotFoundError("File not available")
            
        # Forward without revealing source
        forwarded_msg = await self.bot.copy_message(
            chat_id=user_id,
            from_chat_id=file_info['source_channel'],
            message_id=file_info['message_id'],
            caption="ðŸ“š Course File" # Generic caption
        )
        
        # Log delivery (without identity correlation)
        await self.log_anonymous_delivery(file_id, user_id)
        return forwarded_msg
```

## Configuration Examples

### Channel Configuration
```yaml
# channels.yaml
channels:
  primary:
    - channel_id: -1001234567890
      username: "primary_courses"
      priority: 1
      
  backup:
    - channel_id: -1001234567891
      username: "backup_courses_1"
      priority: 2
    - channel_id: -1001234567892
      username: "backup_courses_2"  
      priority: 3
      
health_check:
  interval: 300  # 5 minutes
  timeout: 30    # 30 seconds
  retry_count: 3
```
