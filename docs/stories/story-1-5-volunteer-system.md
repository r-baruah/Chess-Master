## Technical Implementation Notes

### Volunteer Dashboard Interface
```python
class VolunteerDashboard:
    def __init__(self, supabase_client, redis_client):
        self.supabase = supabase_client
        self.redis = redis_client
        
    async def get_volunteer_dashboard(self, volunteer_id: str):
        """Generate volunteer dashboard with pending reviews and statistics"""
        # Get assigned reviews
        pending_reviews = await self.get_pending_reviews(volunteer_id)
        
        # Get volunteer statistics
        stats = await self.get_volunteer_stats(volunteer_id)
        
        # Get recent activity
        recent_activity = await self.get_recent_activity(volunteer_id)
        
        dashboard = {
            'pending_reviews': len(pending_reviews),
            'reviews_this_week': stats['weekly_reviews'],
            'average_review_time': stats['avg_review_time'],
            'approval_rate': stats['approval_rate'],
            'queue': pending_reviews[:10],  # Show top 10 priority items
            'recent_activity': recent_activity
        }
        
        return dashboard
        
    async def get_course_for_review(self, course_id: str):
        """Fetch complete course data for review interface"""
        course = await self.supabase.table('courses').select('*').eq('id', course_id).single().execute()
        files = await self.supabase.table('course_files').select('*').eq('course_id', course_id).execute()
        
        return {
            'course': course.data,
            'files': files.data,
            'review_guidelines': await self.get_review_guidelines(course.data['category'])
        }
```

### Review Decision Processing
```python
class ReviewDecisionProcessor:
    async def process_approval(self, course_id: str, reviewer_id: str, feedback: str = None):
        """Process course approval decision"""
        # Update course status
        await self.supabase.table('courses').update({
            'status': 'approved',

        }).eq('id', course_id).execute()
        
        # Update review record
        await self.supabase.table('reviews').update({
            'status': 'approved',
            'reviewer_feedback': feedback,
            'reviewed_at': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'reviewer_id': reviewer_id
        }).eq('course_id', course_id).execute()
        
        # Trigger publication workflow
        await self.publication_manager.publish_course(course_id)
        
        # Update volunteer statistics
        await self.update_volunteer_stats(reviewer_id, 'approval')
        
        # Notify contributor
        course = await self.get_course_by_id(course_id)
        await self.notify_contributor_approval(course['contributor_id'], course_id, feedback)
        
    async def process_rejection(self, course_id: str, reviewer_id: str, reason: str, feedback: str):
        """Process course rejection with mandatory feedback"""
        # Update course status
        await self.supabase.table('courses').update({
            'status': 'rejected',

        course = await self.get_course_by_id(course_id)
        await self.notify_contributor_rejection(course['contributor_id'], course_id, reason, feedback)
```

### Assignment Distribution Algorithm
```python
class ReviewAssignmentManager:
    async def distribute_assignments(self):
        """Distribute pending reviews to available volunteers"""
        # Get all pending reviews
        pending_reviews = await self.get_pending_unassigned_reviews()
        
        # Get available volunteers with capacity
        available_volunteers = await self.get_available_volunteers()
        
        for review in pending_reviews:
            # Find best volunteer for this review
            best_volunteer = await self.find_optimal_volunteer(review, available_volunteers)
            
            if best_volunteer:
                await self.assign_review(review['id'], best_volunteer['id'])
                available_volunteers = await self.update_volunteer_capacity(best_volunteer, available_volunteers)
                
    async def find_optimal_volunteer(self, review: dict, volunteers: list):
        """Find optimal volunteer based on workload, expertise, and availability"""
        scored_volunteers = []
        
        for volunteer in volunteers:
            score = 0
            
            # Workload factor (lower workload = higher score)
            workload_score = max(0, 100 - volunteer['current_workload'])
            score += workload_score * 0.4
            
            # Expertise factor (category match = higher score)
            if review['course_category'] in volunteer.get('preferred_categories', []):
                score += 30
                
            # Performance factor (higher approval rate = higher score)
            score += volunteer['approval_rate'] * 0.3

            avg_response_hours = volunteer.get('avg_response_time', 24)
            response_score = max(0, 48 - avg_response_hours) / 48 * 100
            score += response_score * 0.3
            
            scored_volunteers.append((volunteer, score))
            
        # Sort by score and return best match
        scored_volunteers.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return scored_volunteers[0][0] if scored_volunteers else None
```

### Performance Metrics System
```python
class VolunteerMetricsManager:
    async def calculate_volunteer_performance(self, volunteer_id: str, period: str = '30d'):
        """Calculate comprehensive volunteer performance metrics"""
        end_date = datetime.utcnow()
        start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30 if period == '30d' else 7)
        
        # Get reviews in period
        reviews = await self.supabase.table('reviews').select('*').eq('reviewer_id', volunteer_id)\
                    .gte('reviewed_at', start_date.isoformat())\
                    .lte('reviewed_at', end_date.isoformat()).execute()
        
        if not reviews.data:
            return self.default_metrics()
            
        total_reviews = len(reviews.data)
        approved_reviews = len([r for r in reviews.data if r['status'] == 'approved'])
        
        # Calculate metrics
        approval_rate = (approved_reviews / total_reviews) * 100 if total_reviews > 0 else 0
        
        # Calculate average review time
        review_times = []
        for review in reviews.data:
            if review['reviewed_at'] and review['created_at']:
                review_time = (datetime.fromisoformat(review['reviewed_at']) - 
                             datetime.fromisoformat(review['created_at'])).total_seconds() / 3600
                review_times.append(review_time)
                
        avg_review_time = sum(review_times) / len(review_times) if review_times else 24
        
        return {
            'total_reviews': total_reviews,
            'approval_rate': round(approval_rate, 1),
            'avg_review_time_hours': round(avg_review_time, 1),
            'reviews_per_week': round(total_reviews / 4.3, 1),

        }
```
