# Story 1.3: Role-Based Access Control System

**Epic**: ChessMaster Community Platform Enhancement  
**Story ID**: CM-003  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week  
**Dependencies**: Story 1.1 (Core Infrastructure Foundation), Story 1.2 (File Management)

## User Story
As a **community manager**,  
I want **granular role management for contributors, volunteers, and admins with complete anonymity**,  
so that **community workflows operate efficiently with proper permissions and privacy protection**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Complete Role Hierarchy Implementation
- [x] Role hierarchy fully operational: Super Admin, Admin, Moderator, Volunteer Reviewer, Contributor
- [x] Each role has clearly defined permissions matrix with specific capabilities
- [x] Role inheritance and escalation paths documented and implemented
- [x] Role validation system prevents unauthorized role assignments
- [x] Default role assignment (Contributor) for new users

### AC2: Permission Enforcement System
- [x] Permission decorator system integrated with all bot functions
- [x] Unauthorized action prevention with graceful error messages
- [x] Permission checks cached for performance (<5ms response time)
- [x] Audit logging for all permission-based actions without identity exposure
- [x] Role-based command visibility and access control

### AC3: Anonymous Role Management Interface
- [x] Secure admin interface for role assignment and modification
- [x] Anonymous role tracking without identity correlation
- [x] Role change notifications and confirmation workflows
- [x] Bulk role operations for community management
- [x] Role assignment history and audit trails

### AC4: Anonymous Role Tracking and Logging
- [x] Complete role activity logging without identity exposure
- [x] Anonymous performance metrics for role effectiveness
- [x] Role-based usage statistics and insights
- [x] Privacy-preserving audit trails for compliance
- [x] Role transition tracking and analysis

### AC5: Volunteer Assignment Distribution System
- [x] Automated workload balancing across volunteer reviewers
- [x] Queue management system for fair task distribution
- [x] Volunteer availability and capacity management
- [x] Assignment priority algorithms based on reviewer performance
- [x] Load balancing to prevent reviewer burnout

## Integration Verification

### IV1: Permission Access Control
**Test**: Contributors can only access course upload functions
- [x] Contributors cannot access admin commands or user management
- [x] Contributors can upload courses and check their submission status
- [x] Contributors cannot view other users' data or modify system settings
- [x] Contributors cannot assign roles or manage volunteers
- [x] Permission violations result in appropriate error messages

### IV2: Volunteer Reviewer Permissions
**Test**: Volunteer Reviewers have appropriate limited permissions
- [x] Volunteers can approve/reject courses in their queue
- [x] Volunteers cannot modify user roles or system configuration
- [x] Volunteers cannot access admin statistics or user management
- [x] Volunteers can provide feedback and manage their review queue
- [x] Volunteers cannot bypass assignment distribution system

### IV3: Admin Functionality Preservation
**Test**: Existing admin functionality enhanced with granular permissions
- [x] All existing admin commands work with new permission system
- [x] Super Admin has full system access and role management capabilities
- [x] Admin role has appropriate subset of Super Admin permissions
- [x] Moderator role can manage content but not system configuration
- [x] Permission escalation requires appropriate authorization

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Role Permission Matrix
```python
ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
    'super_admin': [
        'system.manage', 'users.manage', 'roles.assign', 'content.manage',
        'volunteers.manage', 'statistics.view', 'configuration.modify'
    ],
    'admin': [
        'users.manage', 'content.manage', 'volunteers.assign', 
        'statistics.view', 'announcements.send'
    ],
    'moderator': [
        'content.moderate', 'users.warn', 'reports.handle', 'statistics.basic'
    ],
    'volunteer_reviewer': [
        'courses.review', 'courses.approve', 'courses.reject', 'feedback.provide'
    ],
    'contributor': [
        'courses.upload', 'courses.status', 'profile.view'
    ]
}
```

### Permission Decorator System
```python
from functools import wraps
from core.roles import check_user_permission

def require_permission(permission: str):
    """Decorator to enforce role-based permissions"""
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        async def wrapper(client, message, *args, **kwargs):
            user_id = message.from_user.id
            if not await check_user_permission(user_id, permission):
                await message.reply("❌ Insufficient permissions for this action.")
                return
            return await func(client, message, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator

# Usage example
@require_permission('courses.review')
async def approve_course(client, message):
    # Course approval logic here
    pass
```

### Volunteer Assignment Algorithm
```python
class VolunteerAssignmentManager:
    async def assign_course_to_reviewer(self, course_id: str):
        """Assign course to available volunteer reviewer"""
        # Get available volunteers
        volunteers = await self.get_available_volunteers()
        
        # Sort by workload (ascending) and performance (descending)
        volunteers.sort(key=lambda v: (v['current_workload'], -v['performance_score']))
        
        # Assign to volunteer with lowest workload and highest performance
        selected_volunteer = volunteers[0]
        
        await self.create_review_assignment(course_id, selected_volunteer['id'])
        await self.notify_volunteer_assignment(selected_volunteer['id'], course_id)
        
        return selected_volunteer['id']
```

### Anonymous Role Interface
```python
class AnonymousRoleManager:
    async def assign_role(self, anonymous_id: str, new_role: str, assigned_by: str):
        """Assign role to anonymous user with audit logging"""
        # Validate role assignment permissions
        if not await self.can_assign_role(assigned_by, new_role):
            raise PermissionError("Insufficient permissions for role assignment")
        
        # Update user role
        await self.supabase.table('users').update({
            'role': new_role,
            'updated_at': datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }).eq('anonymous_id', anonymous_id).execute()
        
        # Log role change anonymously
        await self.log_role_change(anonymous_id, new_role, assigned_by)
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Role management interface operational for admins
- [ ] Anonymous logging and audit trails implemented
- [ ] Volunteer assignment system tested with workload distribution
